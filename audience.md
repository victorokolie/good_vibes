For my target audience, I have a scenario.
First, a person with psoriasis reads the article because they want to know what on earth can help them ease the suffering.
They fall into my blog and surely they are amazed by the possibilities I opened to them through the information about
special triggers and apps which help find triggers. 
The article is being shared immediately on any social media platform. Another person on their social media list notices this 
post and gets curious: what is the other person sharing and why do they like it so much? What is psoriasis?

So, an interested person reads about psoriasis the first time ever and gets enlighted as well as caught by the possibilities coming with the introduced apps
which are provided in the text - since it is clearly mentioned that some of them are not specifically only for psoriasis patients,
but can be used in everyday life as well. Certainly the second person (not suffering from psoriasis) will share the article again and the 
chain goes on.

The outcome: my target audience would be 1. people suffering from psoriasis and 2. people who don't but are interested, the one way or the other.
But over time, i guess this blog article would be more than just some kind of rescue for patients but common knowlegde in general ;)
